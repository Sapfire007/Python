# importing everything
# It's also possible to import all functions and variables from a module using the * wildcard. However, this is generally not recommended as it can lead to confusion and make it harder to understand where specific functions and variables are coming from.
from math import *

result = sqrt(9)
print(result)  # Output: 3.0
print(ceil(5.21114))
print(pi)  # Output: 3.141592653589793
