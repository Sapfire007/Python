# Python also allows you to rename imported modules using the as keyword. This can be useful if you want to use a shorter or more descriptive name for a module, or if you want to avoid naming conflicts with other modules or variables in your code.
# The "as" keyword
import math as m

result = m.sqrt(9)
print(result)  # Output: 3.0

print(m.pi)  # Output: 3.141592653589793
